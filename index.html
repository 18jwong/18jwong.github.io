			<p>ClassNeeds is a website that helps students find out more about classes.</p>
			</br>
			<p>Currently, it only supports UCSC's CSE upper division courses. This was a group project for UCSC's CSE 115 and was created by 4 people in approximately 4 weeks using the Agile/Scrum process. I mostly contributed to the Ratings system, Curriculum page, and unit testing of the site, while learning to interact with a database for the first time.</p>

			<h3>Blobs</h3>

			</a>
			
			<p>Blobs is a casual incremental game created during Ludum Dare 47 (game jam).</p>
			</br>
			<p>This was my second game jam. I decided to work solo on this one so that I could enter the "compo," which is a more competitive version of the game jam that only allows for 48 hours rather than 72. Every asset (music, 3D models, art) was created myself, as the compo rules required. I wasn't a huge fan of the theme ("stuck in a loop") so I spent almost 24 hours coming up with an idea (not ideal of course). I finally settled on the idea of getting blobs physically stuck in a loop and just let the "fun" guide me, since this was to be a simple game jam project anyway. </p>
			</br>
			<p>Blobs currently has 76 views and 48 browser plays.</p>
