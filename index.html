			<p>ClassNeeds is a website that helps students find out more about classes.</p>
			</br>
			<p>Currently, it only supports UCSC's CSE upper division courses. This was a group project for UCSC's CSE 115 and was created by 4 people in approximately 4 weeks using the Agile/Scrum process. I mostly contributed to the Ratings system, Curriculum page, and unit testing of the site, while learning to interact with a database for the first time.</p>
